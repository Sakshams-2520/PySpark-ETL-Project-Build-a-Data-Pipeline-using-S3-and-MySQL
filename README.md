# PySpark-ETL-Project-Build-a-Data-Pipeline-using-S3-and-MySQL

Business Overview

Apache Spark is a distributed processing engine that is open source and used for large data applications. It uses in-memory caching and 
efficient query execution for quick analytic queries against any quantity of data. It offers code reuse across many workloads such as batch processing, 
interactive queries, real-time analytics, machine learning, and graph processing. It provides development APIs in Java, Scala, Python, and R.

 

Data Pipeline

A data pipeline is a technique for transferring data from one system to another. The data may or may not be updated, and it may be handled in 
real-time (or streaming) rather than in batches. The data pipeline encompasses everything from harvesting or acquiring data using various methods to storing 
raw data, cleaning, validating, and transforming data into a query-worthy format, displaying KPIs, and managing the above process.

 

Agenda

This is the sixth project in the Pyspark series. The fifth project involved the introduction to PySpark SQL, SQL function, and various joins available in 
PySpark SQL with the help of business case study. This project mainly focuses on the integration of PySpark with Amazon S3 and MySQL database to perform 
ETL(Extract-Transform-Load) and ELT(Extract-Load-Transform) operations.

 

Tech stack:  

➔Language: Python

➔Package: Pyspark

➔Services: AWS S3, MySQL

 

PySpark:

PySpark is a Python interface for Apache Spark. It not only lets you develop Spark applications using Python APIs, but it also includes the PySpark 
shell for interactively examining data in a distributed context. PySpark supports most of Spark's capabilities, including Spark SQL, DataFrame, Streaming, 
MLlib, and Spark Core. In this project, you will learn about core Spark architecture, Spark Sessions, Transformation, Actions, and Optimization Techniques using PySpark.

 

MySQL

MySQL is a SQL (Structured Query Language) based relational database management system. The platform can be used for data warehousing, e-commerce, logging 
applications, etc.

 

Amazon S3

Amazon S3 is a simple web service interface for object storage that allows you to store and retrieve unlimited amounts of data from anywhere on the internet. 
It is used for Backup and archive for on-premises or cloud data Content, media, and software storage and distribution.
